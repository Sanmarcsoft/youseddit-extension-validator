# Product Requirements Document (PRD): C2PA Image Verification Extension

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for a Chrome web extension designed to enhance trust and transparency in digital media by verifying the authenticity and origin of images using C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) metadata. The extension will identify images larger than 50x50 pixels, detect C2PA metadata, and provide a visual indicator that links to a detailed metadata viewer.

### 1.2 Scope
The initial scope focuses on image verification within the Chrome browser environment. Future iterations may expand to other media types and browsers.

### 1.3 Definitions
*   **C2PA:** Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, an open technical standard for content provenance.
*   **C2PA Metadata:** Digital information embedded within media files that describes their origin, history, and modifications.
*   **Extension:** The Chrome web browser extension.
*   **Metadata Viewer:** A local HTML page within the extension that displays detailed C2PA information.

## 2. User Stories

### 2.1 Core Functionality
*   As a user, I want the extension to automatically scan images on any webpage I visit.
*   As a user, I want the extension to only process images larger than 50x50 pixels to avoid cluttering small icons.
*   As a user, I want to see a clear visual indicator on images that contain C2PA metadata.
*   As a user, I want to click on the C2PA indicator icon to view detailed provenance information about the image.
*   As a user, I want the metadata viewer page to display the original full-size image alongside its C2PA metadata.

### 2.2 User Experience
*   As a user, I want the C2PA indicator icon to be small and non-intrusive.
*   As a user, I want the metadata viewer page to be easy to understand and navigate.

### 2.3 Performance
*   As a user, I want the extension to not significantly impact webpage loading times.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Image Scanning and Filtering
*   **FR1.1:** The extension SHALL intercept image loading requests on all visited webpages.
*   **FR1.2:** The extension SHALL determine the dimensions (width and height) of each loaded image.
*   **FR1.3:** The extension SHALL filter out images that are smaller than 50x50 pixels.

### 3.2 C2PA Metadata Detection
*   **FR2.1:** For images larger than 50x50 pixels, the extension SHALL attempt to read and parse C2PA metadata.
*   **FR2.2:** The extension SHALL utilize a C2PA library (e.g., `c2pa-js`) for metadata extraction.
*   **FR2.3:** The extension SHALL identify if valid C2PA metadata is present within the image.

### 3.3 C2PA Indicator Icon
*   **FR3.1:** If C2PA metadata is detected, the extension SHALL inject a small, distinct icon onto the webpage, overlaid on or near the image.
*   **FR3.2:** The icon SHALL be visually distinguishable and indicate the presence of C2PA metadata.
*   **FR3.3:** The icon SHALL be a hyperlink.

### 3.4 Metadata Viewer Page
*   **FR4.1:** The hyperlink on the C2PA indicator icon SHALL open a new tab or a local extension page (e.g., `public/iframe.html` or a new dedicated HTML page) within the browser.
*   **FR4.2:** The metadata viewer page SHALL display the parsed C2PA metadata in a human-readable format.
*   **FR4.3:** The metadata viewer page SHALL display the full-size original image for which the metadata is being shown.
*   **FR4.4:** The metadata viewer page SHALL be a local page maintained by the extension, not requiring external network requests for its content.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance
*   **NFR1.1:** The extension SHALL have minimal impact on browser performance and page load times.
*   **NFR1.2:** C2PA metadata processing SHALL be efficient and non-blocking.

### 4.2 Security
*   **NFR2.1:** The extension SHALL adhere to Chrome extension security best practices.
*   **NFR2.2:** All local data storage SHALL be secure and isolated to the extension.

### 4.3 Usability
*   **NFR3.1:** The C2PA indicator icon SHALL be unobtrusive and not interfere with webpage content.
*   **NFR3.2:** The metadata viewer page SHALL be intuitive and easy to navigate.

### 4.4 Compatibility
*   **NFR4.1:** The extension SHALL be compatible with the latest stable version of Google Chrome.

### 4.5 Maintainability
*   **NFR5.1:** The codebase SHALL be well-structured, documented, and follow established coding standards.

## 5. Technical Considerations

### 5.1 Architecture
*   **Background Script:** To monitor network requests and manage C2PA processing.
*   **Content Script:** To inject the C2PA indicator icon onto webpages.
*   **Offscreen Document/Iframe:** To host the C2PA metadata viewer page locally.

### 5.2 Technologies
*   **JavaScript/TypeScript:** For extension logic.
*   **HTML/CSS:** For UI components (icon, viewer page).
*   **C2PA.js Library:** For C2PA metadata parsing and validation.

### 5.3 Data Flow
1.  User navigates to a webpage.
2.  Background script intercepts image requests.
3.  Image dimensions are checked.
4.  If > 50x50px, image data is passed to C2PA processing.
5.  C2PA metadata is extracted.
6.  Content script receives notification of C2PA presence.
7.  Content script injects C2PA icon.
8.  User clicks icon.
9.  Local metadata viewer page opens, displaying metadata and original image.

## 6. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for MVP)
*   Support for other media types (video, audio).
*   Integration with external C2PA verification services.
*   Advanced C2PA manifest visualization.
*   User preferences for icon display.
*   Cross-browser compatibility (Firefox, Edge).
