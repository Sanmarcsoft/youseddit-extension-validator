# Meeting Script: "The C2PA Conundrum"

## Episode 1: The Kickoff

**Characters:**
*   **Roo:** Product Manager (Enthusiastic, organized, slightly overwhelmed)
*   **Devin:** Frontend Developer (Chill, focused on UI, prone to CSS debates)
*   **Alex:** Extension Logic Developer (Analytical, deep in code, speaks in technical terms)
*   **Jamie:** QA Engineer (Detail-oriented, always thinking about edge cases)
*   **Casey:** UI/UX Designer (Creative, visual thinker, sometimes gets lost in abstract concepts)

**Setting:** A slightly cluttered virtual meeting room. Whiteboard visible in the background with "C2PA Extension" scribbled on it.

**(SCENE START)**

**Roo:** (Beaming) Alright team, settle in, settle in! Welcome to the inaugural meeting for our groundbreaking C2PA Image Verification Extension! I'm Roo, your fearless Product Manager, and I'm absolutely thrilled to kick this off.

**Devin:** (Sipping coffee) Morning, Roo. Ready to make some pixels dance.

**Alex:** (Typing furiously, not looking up) Morning. My IDE is already compiling.

**Jamie:** (Adjusting glasses) Just finished reviewing the PRD. Found a potential edge case with animated GIFs. We should discuss.

**Casey:** (Holding up a sketchpad) I've got some initial icon concepts! Thinking something sleek, maybe a little blockchain-y?

**Roo:** (Chuckles) Excellent energy, everyone! That's what I like to hear. So, as you all know, the core idea is to empower users with transparency in digital media. We're building a Chrome extension that scans images, checks for C2PA metadata, and if found, displays a small icon that links to a detailed viewer page.

**Alex:** (Finally looks up) To clarify, the image size filter is 50x50 pixels, correct? And we're using `c2pa-js` for metadata parsing? I've already started looking into the integration points for the background script. We'll need to handle image data efficiently to avoid performance hits.

**Roo:** Precisely, Alex! You've hit the nail on the head regarding performance. That's a key non-functional requirement. Devin, on the frontend, your main task for this phase is to get that icon injected and make sure the local metadata viewer page is ready to display the information Alex's logic provides.

**Devin:** Got it. I'm thinking a subtle overlay, maybe a small badge in the corner of the image. And for the viewer page, we can leverage `public/iframe.html` as a starting point, right? Just need to make sure it's dynamic enough to pull in the image and metadata.

**Casey:** (Nods enthusiastically) Yes! And the icon needs to be clear but not distracting. I'll work on a few variations for the badge. For the viewer page, let's ensure it's clean, easy to read, and visually connects the metadata to the image. Maybe a split-panel layout?

**Jamie:** (Raises a hand) Speaking of the viewer page, how will we handle images that are very large? Will the viewer page scale them down, or show the original size? And what about images that fail C2PA validation? Will there be a distinct visual cue for that, or just no icon?

**Roo:** Great questions, Jamie! For the MVP, the viewer page will display the full-size original, but we'll need to ensure it's responsive within the page. For validation failures, initially, no icon will appear. We can add more nuanced feedback in later phases. Your role, Jamie, is crucial in identifying these edge cases early.

**Jamie:** Understood. I'll start drafting test cases for image loading, icon display, and the viewer page functionality. I'll also look into how we can simulate C2PA-enabled images for testing.

**Roo:** Perfect! Now, I've set up a Kanban board â€“ you'll all find it linked in the team chat. I've pre-populated it with our initial tasks, broken down by role. Please review your tasks, add any sub-tasks you identify, and move them through "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."

**Alex:** (Still typing, but with a slight smile) Sounds efficient. I'll be in "In Progress" for a while.

**Devin:** (Stretches) Alright, time to make some magic happen.

**Casey:** I'm off to sketch some more icons!

**Roo:** (Claps hands) Fantastic! Let's aim for a quick sync-up mid-week to check on progress. Any final questions before we dive in?

(Silence, except for Alex's typing)

**Roo:** Excellent! Let's build something amazing, team!
