# AI START HERE: C2PA Image Verification Extension Project Status

This document provides a quick overview of the C2PA Image Verification Extension project, its current status, key documents, and immediate next steps. It is designed to bring any AI agent up to speed instantly.

## 1. Project Overview

The C2PA Image Verification Extension is a Chrome web extension aimed at enhancing trust and transparency in digital media. It will scan webpages for images larger than 50x50 pixels, detect embedded C2PA metadata, and provide a visual indicator. Clicking this indicator will open a local viewer page displaying detailed C2PA provenance information and the original full-size image.

## 2. Current Project State

The initial planning and documentation phase for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is complete. Key foundational documents have been created to guide development. The team roles, initial tasks, and a Kanban board for tracking progress have been established.

### 2.1 Recent AI Session Summary (Debugging Core Logic)

During the recent AI session, the focus was on implementing the core extension logic in `src/content.ts` to intercept images, filter them, and use `c2pa-js` for metadata detection, logging the results.

**Tasks Completed:**
- Implemented image interception, filtering ( > 50x50 pixels), and basic C2PA metadata detection in [`src/content.ts`](src/content.ts).
- Added logging in [`src/inject.ts`](src/inject.ts) and [`src/c2pa.ts`](src/c2pa.ts) to diagnose issues with icon status and data serialization.

**Issues Identified During Debugging:**
- **Trusted Images Status:** Images expected to show a green trust indicator are currently showing an error status. Analysis of C2PA data reveals expired certificates without trusted timestamps in the test files, leading to a technically correct 'error' status according to the current logic. This suggests a potential misalignment between UAT expectations and test data.
- **Untrusted Images Icon:** Images identified as untrusted (having C2PA data but no trusted list match) are correctly assigned a 'warning' status, but their icons are unexpectedly disappearing after being set. The cause of this removal is still under investigation.
- **Broken Ingredient Thumbnails:** Thumbnail images for ingredients in the C2PA metadata overlay pop-up are not displaying. This was traced to the serialization logic in [`src/c2pa.ts`](src/c2pa.ts) where ingredient thumbnail data was not being converted to a data URL.
- **Missing C2PA Data Icon:** A requirement was identified to display an exclamation icon for images that *should* have C2PA data but don't. The criteria for identifying such images are not yet defined.
- **Tool Limitation:** A tool repetition limit for `read_file` and `apply_diff` was encountered, preventing further immediate code modifications and detailed file analysis in this session.

## 3. Key Project Documents

The following core documents have been generated and are available in the root directory:

*   [`PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md`](PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md): Outlines the strategic vision, goals, and phased development plan for the extension from MVP to future enhancements.
*   [`PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md`](PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md): Details the functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, and technical considerations for the extension.
*   [`SANMARCSOFT_TEAM_AND_TASKS.md`](SANMARCSOFT_TEAM_AND_TASKS.md): Defines the roles and initial responsibilities for each development team member (Product Manager, Frontend Developer, Extension Logic Developer, QA Engineer, UI/UX Designer) and their respective initial tasks.
*   [`MEETING_SCRIPT_SITCOM.md`](MEETING_SCRIPT_SITCOM.md): A "sitcom script" encapsulating the key discussion points and team dynamics from the initial project kickoff meeting.
*   [`KANBAN_BOARD.md`](KANBAN_BOARD.md): A Kanban board tracking the initial tasks for the MVP phase, categorized into "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."

## 4. File and Folder Status

The repository contains the foundational structure for a Chrome extension, including:
*   `src/`: Contains the TypeScript source code for the extension's background scripts, content scripts, C2PA integration, and UI logic. This is where the core development will occur.
*   `public/`: Contains static assets like HTML pages (`iframe.html`, `popup.html`, `options.html`) and CSS files for the extension's UI, as well as icons.
*   `test/`: Contains various test files and media for C2PA validation and extension testing.
*   `patches/`: Contains a patch for the `c2pa` library.

The project is set up with `package.json` for dependency management (likely `npm` or `pnpm`), `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration, and `rollup.config.js` for bundling.

## 5. Next Steps / Current Focus

Based on the `KANBAN_BOARD.md` and the recent debugging session, the immediate focus is on addressing the identified issues and continuing development.

A detailed plan for the next AI session, including specific tasks to tackle the unresolved issues, can be found in [`AI_NEXT_SESSION_PLAN.md`](AI_NEXT_SESSION_PLAN.md).

Key areas of focus include:

*   **Development Environment Setup:** [DONE] `pnpm install` has been run and the extension has been successfully built and loaded into Chrome for testing.
*   **Initial Prototyping & Integration:**
    *   Frontend (Devin): Prototyping icon injection and basic viewer page layout.
    *   Extension Logic (Alex): Integrating `c2pa-js` and implementing image interception/parsing.
*   **Design & Planning:**
    *   UI/UX (Casey): Designing the icon and viewer page wireframes.
    *   QA (Jamie): Developing initial test plans and beginning manual testing.

The Product Manager (Roo) will oversee these initial tasks, facilitate communication, and ensure alignment with the PRD and Roadmap.
