## Single Purpose Description
Verify the authenticity and provenance of images, videos, and audio on any webpage using the C2PA content credentials standard.

## Detailed Description

Verifieddit is a free, open-source browser extension that verifies Content Credentials (C2PA) embedded in images, videos, and audio files on any website you visit.

**What are Content Credentials?**
Content Credentials are a new open standard (C2PA) for proving where digital content came from and how it was created or modified. Major organisations including Adobe, Google, Microsoft, and the BBC have adopted the C2PA standard.

**Key Features:**

- Automatic Detection: Scans media elements on any webpage for C2PA content credentials
- Visual Indicators: Shows overlay icons on media with verified content credentials (green = valid, yellow = warning, red = invalid)
- AI Origin, As Declared: Reports the IPTC `digitalSourceType` the signer recorded in their own signed manifest. It reads a declaration; it does not analyse pixels or guess. Media carrying no such declaration is shown as "not declared", never as "not AI"
- Interactive Provenance Graph: Explore the full chain of custody as a graph — click a node to expand its detail, drag to pan, zoom, fit to frame, or open it full screen. Shows multi-generation ingredient history, assertions, and sensor telemetry
- Certificate Verification: Validates signer certificates against the C2PA Trust List, including RFC 3161 trusted timestamps
- Right-Click Inspection: Right-click any image, video, or audio to inspect its Content Credentials
- Trust List Management: Ships all 29 anchors from the C2PA Conformance Program and the 21 official timestamp authorities; import your own trust anchors and TSA certificates alongside them
- Auto-Scan Toggle: Enable or disable automatic scanning per your preference

**Privacy-First:**
- All processing happens locally in your browser using WebAssembly
- No media files are ever uploaded to any server
- No analytics, tracking, or telemetry
- No account required

**What It Can Read:**
Photographs, video, audio, and PDF documents, across sixteen file formats: the ones the web is built on, the raw formats photographers shoot in, and the newer formats publishers have started serving. The current list is in the repository README.

## Permission Justifications

### storage
Saves the user's auto-scan preference and a local cache of the loaded trust lists in the browser. Nothing is synced to a server.

### activeTab
Accesses the currently active tab when the user clicks the toolbar action or selects an item from the right-click context menu, scoped to that single interaction.

### contextMenus
Adds "Verify with Verifieddit." to the right-click context menu on images, videos, and audio elements.

### alarms
Schedules periodic trust list refreshes (every 24 hours, `TRUSTLIST_UPDATE_INTERVAL = 1440`) for trust lists the user has imported. The bundled lists carry no `download_url` and are never re-fetched.

### storage (durable-credential check)
The opt-in for the manifest-store lookup is kept in `chrome.storage.local` under `manifestStoreProbe`, default `false`. No separate permission is required; it is noted here because it governs the only automatic outbound request.

### offscreen
Hosts the C2PA WebAssembly verification engine in an offscreen document. A Manifest V3 service worker cannot run the WASM toolkit directly, so verification work is delegated to this document. It renders nothing to the user, performs no network calls of its own, and exists only for the duration of verification.

### Host Permissions: <all_urls>
The extension needs access to all URLs because C2PA content credentials can appear on any website. The extension scans image, video, and audio elements on the current page to detect and verify cryptographic provenance data embedded in media files. Without broad host access, users would need to manually allowlist every website, defeating the purpose of automatic content credential detection.

## Data Sent Off-Device

Declare in the CWS Privacy tab as **Website content → App functionality**. Two
user-initiated navigations, both plain link clicks, neither automatic:

| Destination | When | What travels |
|---|---|---|
| `www.verifieddit.com/?url=<media-url>` | User clicks "Inspect on Verifieddit" | The URL of the one media file they chose to inspect |
| `www.trusteddit.com/?src=<surface>` | User clicks "Sign your own content with Trusteddit" | A constant naming which extension surface the link was clicked from. No user, device, asset or session identifier |
| `manifests.sanmarcsoft.com/v1/matches/byBinding` | **Only after the user opts in** to "Check durable credentials online" (off by default), for images whose credential declares a durable binding | A perceptual hash of the image (pHash + dHash). Never the image, never a user, device or session identifier. `credentials: 'omit'` |

The `src` value is drawn from a fixed set (`extension-panel`, `extension-popup`,
`extension-options`, `extension-context-menu`, `extension-release-notes`) and is
disclosed by the receiving sites: verifieddit.com privacy policy §2.8 and
trusteddit.com privacy policy §2.5, both published before the parameter shipped.

The manifest-store lookup is the extension's only request not begun by a click,
which is why it ships off and is granted in context: the "Cloud-recoverable"
pillar in the panel states what would be sent before anything is. Consent
applies forward only — enabling it never re-checks media already on screen.

Beyond these, the extension collects nothing, sends no analytics, and sets no
cookies. Verified against the source: zero analytics SDKs, and no
`document.cookie`, `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` anywhere in `src/`.

## Screenshots

Captured from the built v1.1.0 extension in real Chrome, 1280x800. Regenerate
with `bun scripts/capture-listing-screenshots.mjs` after any UI change — stale
screenshots that show a superseded interface are a listing-accuracy defect.

| # | File | Shows |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `releases/screenshots/01-detection.png` | Badges overlaid on credentialed media across a live page |
| 2 | `releases/screenshots/02-provenance-graph.png` | The interactive provenance graph in the panel, node expanded |
| 3 | `releases/screenshots/03-graph-fullscreen.png` | The graph full screen, showing a multi-generation chain |
| 4 | `releases/screenshots/04-popup-validation.png` | Popup Validation tab with the graph for the current page |
| 5 | `releases/screenshots/05-popup-trustlists.png` | Popup Trust Lists tab, official C2PA + TSA anchors loaded |

Held in the repo but not uploaded (CWS caps the listing at five):
`06-popup-about.png` (About tab, version + what's new). The right-click item is
not captured: Chrome renders that menu natively, outside the page, so no
automated capture can include it honestly.
