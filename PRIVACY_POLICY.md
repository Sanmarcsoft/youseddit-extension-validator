# Verifieddit Browser Extension: Privacy Policy

**Applies to:** the Verifieddit browser extension for Chrome and Firefox
(extension ID `verifieddit@verifieddit.com`), version 1.2.5 and later.
**Version:** 1.0 · **Effective:** 2026-09-06

This document covers the **extension only**. The Verifieddit website has its own
policy at <https://www.verifieddit.com/privacy>, which is a broader document
covering accounts, billing and website analytics. None of that applies here: the
extension has no account, no sign-in, and no analytics. Where the two documents
touch the same behaviour, the website policy sections 2.1, 2.8 and 2.9 and this
document say the same thing, and this document is the more specific one.

## The short version

The extension reads C2PA Content Credentials out of media on the pages you
visit and verifies them **on your device**, in WebAssembly. Your media never
leaves your machine. There is no account, no analytics, no tracking, no
advertising, and no history of what you inspected.

With default settings the extension sends **nothing** to us. Every outbound
request it can make is either started by a click of yours or is a setting you
turned on yourself.

## 2. What happens on your device

When you view a page, or right-click a file and choose "Verify with
Verifieddit.", the extension:

1. Reads the bytes of the image, video, audio file or PDF that is already
   loaded on that page.
2. Parses the embedded C2PA manifest and validates its signature chain against
   trust anchors held locally.
3. Shows you the result: who signed it, whether the bytes changed since
   signing, and what the signer declared about AI origin.

Every step of that happens in your browser. The C2PA engine is a WebAssembly
module shipped inside the extension package. No file content, no extracted
metadata, and no verification result is transmitted anywhere.

## 3. Everything that can leave your device

This is the complete list. There is nothing else.

| # | What is sent | When | Where to | Contains |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | An HTTP request for the media file itself | Whenever a file is verified | The site already hosting that file | Nothing we add. It is the same request your browser makes to display the file. |
| 3.2 | The web address of one media file | Only when you click "Inspect on Verifieddit" | verifieddit.com, in a new tab | The URL you chose, as a `?url=` parameter, visible in your address bar |
| 3.3 | A fixed surface name | Only when you click a link to Trusteddit or Verifieddit | The site you are opening | `?src=` plus one of five fixed words: `extension-panel`, `extension-popup`, `extension-options`, `extension-context-menu`, `extension-release-notes` |
| 3.4 | Two perceptual hashes of one image | Only if you switched the durable-credential check on | manifests.sanmarcsoft.com | A pHash and a dHash computed on your device, sent without cookies |
| 3.5 | A request for an updated trust list | Only for a trust list you imported from a URL yourself | An allowlisted host | Nothing about you. Sent with credentials omitted. |
| 3.6 | A request for a trust list you typed in | Only when you paste a URL into the trust-list importer and click Fetch | The host you typed | Nothing about you. Sent with credentials omitted. |

Notes on the two that deserve detail:

**3.3, the `?src=` parameter.** It names a place in our interface, never you,
your device, your session, or the file you were looking at. It is one of five
fixed strings, it is visible in the address bar of the page it opens, and the
extension does not store, count or report it.

**3.4, the durable-credential check.** Some Content Credentials declare a
durable binding, an invisible watermark that lets a credential be recovered
even after a re-encode or a screenshot strips the metadata. The extension can
confirm such a credential is genuinely registered by asking our manifest store.

This is **off by default** (`MANIFEST_STORE_PROBE_DEFAULT = false` in
`src/constants.ts`). It is the only request the extension makes that you do not
start with a click, which is exactly why it is a choice rather than a default.
Turn it on from the "Cloud-recoverable" panel when you inspect a file, or from
Options; turn it off in the same places. When it is on, and only for images
whose credential declares a durable binding, the request carries two short hash
values and nothing else: not the image, not any part of it, not the page you
found it on, and no identifier for you, your device or your session. Turning it
on applies from that moment forward and never re-examines anything you looked at
earlier. With it off, such files still verify normally; the durable binding is
simply reported as *declared* rather than *confirmed*.

**3.5, the trust list refresh.** A once-daily alarm re-fetches only trust lists
that carry a `download_url`, which means only lists you imported yourself. The
lists bundled with the extension set no `download_url` and are never re-fetched.
Refreshes are further restricted to an allowlist of four hosts:
`contentcredentials.org`, `c2pa.org`, `trusteddit.com`, `verifieddit.com`.

## 4. What is stored, and where

Only on your device, in `chrome.storage.local` and `chrome.storage.session`.
Nothing is synced to a server or to your browser profile sync.

| Key | What it is |
|---|---|
| `autoScan` | Whether automatic scanning is on |
| `manifestStoreProbe` | Whether the durable-credential check is on |
| `trustList` | The cached trust lists, bundled and imported |
| `rc117AutoScanMigrationDone` | A one-time settings migration flag |

Transient C2PA engine startup errors are held in `chrome.storage.session` so the
popup can show a banner if the engine fails to load. Your browser clears that
automatically when it closes.

No browsing history is stored. No verification results are stored. No record of
which media you inspected is stored. Uninstalling the extension removes all of
it.

## 5. What we never do

- No analytics of any kind. There is no Google Analytics, no Sentry, no
  PostHog, no Mixpanel, no Segment, and no home-grown telemetry anywhere in the
  codebase.
- No cookies. No advertising identifiers. No fingerprinting.
- No sale or sharing of data with third parties. There is no data to sell.
- No account, no sign-in, no email address collected.
- No remote code. Every executable byte ships inside the package. The
  WebAssembly module and its worker are loaded from the extension's own origin.

## 6. Permissions, and why each one exists

| Permission | Why it is needed |
|---|---|
| `storage` | The four settings above and the local trust-list cache |
| `activeTab` | Limits the popup and the context menu to the one tab you are acting on, instead of standing access to every tab |
| `contextMenus` | Adds the single item "Verify with Verifieddit." on images, video and audio |
| `alarms` | The once-daily trust-list refresh described in 3.5 |
| `<all_urls>` | Content Credentials can be embedded in media on any site. Restricting this to a fixed list of hosts would mean the extension could only verify media on sites we chose in advance, which defeats its purpose. |
| `offscreen` (Chrome only) | Hosts the WebAssembly engine, because a Manifest V3 service worker cannot run it. It renders nothing, hosts no UI, and makes no network requests of its own. |

`<all_urls>` is a broad permission and we would rather it were narrower. What it
grants here is the ability to read media bytes on the page in front of you. It
is not used to collect page content, record browsing history, or transmit
anything.

## 7. Your controls

- **Automatic scanning:** on or off, in the popup (Chrome) or in Preferences in
  the Add-ons Manager (Firefox). With it off, nothing is verified until you ask.
- **Durable-credential check:** off unless you turn it on, in the same places
  or from the "Cloud-recoverable" panel.
- **Trust lists:** you can add and remove them, including your own.
- **Everything else:** uninstalling removes all locally stored data.

## 8. Your rights

Because the extension stores nothing on our servers and collects no identifier,
we hold no personal data about you arising from its use, and so there is
normally nothing to access, correct, port or erase.

If you are in the EEA, the UK or Switzerland, the GDPR rights of access,
rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, objection and withdrawal of
consent still apply to any personal data Sanmarcsoft LLC does hold about you.
Write to privacy@sanmarcsoft.com with the subject line "GDPR Data Subject
Request" and we will respond within 30 days. California residents have the
equivalent CCPA rights; we do not sell personal information.

You may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. Our production
infrastructure is in France, so the lead authority is the CNIL,
3 Place de Fontenoy, TSA 80715, 75334 Paris Cedex 07, France, <https://www.cnil.fr>.
We would rather you wrote to us first at privacy@sanmarcsoft.com.

## 9. Children

The extension is not directed at children under 13 and collects no data from
anyone, including children.

## 10. Changes

Material changes to this document will be published in this repository, noted in
`CHANGELOG.md`, and reflected in the store listings. The version and effective
date at the top of this file are the record. Because this file is in version
control, every change to it is public and attributable, which is deliberate.

## 11. Checking these claims yourself

You do not have to take our word for any of this. The extension is MIT licensed
and the source is public:

| Claim | Where to check |
|---|---|
| The durable check is off by default | `src/constants.ts`, `MANIFEST_STORE_PROBE_DEFAULT` |
| What the durable check sends | `src/manifestStore.ts` |
| The complete set of network calls | `grep -rn "fetch(" src/` returns exactly five. Four are rows 3.1, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6; the fifth (`src/utils.ts`) is a `data:` URL that reaches no network. |
| The trust-list host allowlist | `src/trustlist.ts`, `ALLOWED_REFRESH_HOSTS` |
| The `?src=` values | `src/constants.ts`, the `ClickSource` type |
| No analytics | `grep -rniE "google-analytics|googletagmanager|gtag\(|\bsentry\b|posthog|mixpanel|@segment|amplitude" src/` returns zero hits |
