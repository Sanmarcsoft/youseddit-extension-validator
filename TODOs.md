# Extension TO-DOs

## Pre-OSS release

* Verify BBC content directly from their web site (e.g., <https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68541911>); if it doesn't work, let's create an issue
* Show cert info in popup UI (when clicking cert icon)
* Fix HTML accessibility
* Delete this TODO.md file, and file remaining tasks as GitHub issues

## Post-OSS release (or pre-OSS stretch goals)

* Add a "verify all assets" option and enable context menu validation
* Migrate to c2pa-wc lib to display validation results
* Add other asset types (GIF, SVG, etc.); see https://github.com/contentauth/c2patool
* Re-start validation if trust list is added
* Countermeasures against malicious pages
* Document attacks and risks (for threat model)
