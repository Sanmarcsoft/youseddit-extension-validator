/*
 * CSV and plain-text export for C2PA provenance nodes.
 *
 * Kept separate from the diagram component because it is pure: given a node it
 * returns a string, with no DOM and no lit. That makes the escaping rules
 * testable without a browser.
 *
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY TRUE HERE, stated carefully because it is easy to overstate.
 *
 * The input is attacker-controlled. A C2PA signature binds a manifest to an
 * asset and proves who signed it; it constrains nothing about what the strings
 * inside say. `claim_generator` reaches the UI raw (provenanceGraph.ts), as do
 * assertion labels, signer fields and telemetry keys: `sanitizeLabel` is applied
 * only to node labels and Mermaid output. This extension also renders untrusted
 * and failed manifests on purpose, because saying "this is not trustworthy" is
 * the product. So hostile strings arriving here is design, not mishap.
 *
 * The payoff is smaller than the folklore. Excel has disabled DDE by default
 * since 2018, so `=cmd|'/c calc'!A0` no longer yields code execution, and a
 * downloaded file opens in Protected View besides. What survives is narrower:
 * `=HYPERLINK(...)` phishing or exfiltration on a user click, `=WEBSERVICE()`
 * where it is enabled, and LibreOffice's more permissive defaults. Data
 * integrity, not remote code execution.
 *
 * So the guard is proportionate rather than maximal. It costs three lines and
 * no runtime, so it stays. It exempts plain numbers, so exported telemetry
 * (`-33.8688` latitude, negative headings) stays numeric in the spreadsheet
 * instead of being turned into text by a reflexive apostrophe. Evidentiary
 * fidelity is the point of an export; a guard that corrupts the data it guards
 * would be the worse bug.
